Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Tab:** Display the five daily prayers with timings, a daily Hadith, and a daily Quran verse.\n*   **Iman Tracker Tab:** Implement three rings to track prayers, Quran reading, and Dhikr. Users can set goals, and the app will visually represent their progress.\n*   **Learning Tab:** Include sections for Islamic lectures, Quran recitations, quizzes, and Duas.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#388E3C` (Dark Green)\n    *   Secondary: `#A5D6A7` (Light Green)\n    *   Accent: `#FFC107` (Amber)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#DCEDC8` (Very Light Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like Roboto or Open Sans for readability.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Structure:** The app structure is already set up with the tabs you mentioned. We'll focus on populating each tab with the features you described.\n2.  **Home Tab Implementation:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display the five daily prayers. Initially, we can use placeholder times.\n    *   Add components to display the daily Hadith and Quran verse. These will initially be static, and we'll integrate Supabase later to fetch dynamic content.\n3.  **Iman Tracker Tab Implementation:**\n    *   Create a new component for the Iman Tracker rings in `app/(tabs)/(iman)/index.tsx`.\n    *   Implement the ring visuals and the goal-setting functionality. Initially, store goals locally.\n4.  **Learning Tab Implementation:**\n    *   Create placeholders for Islamic lectures, Quran recitations, quizzes, and Duas in `app/(tabs)/(learning)/index.tsx`.\n    *   Each section will have a basic layout.\n5.  **Wellness Tab Implementation:**\n    *   Create mental and physical tabs in `app/(tabs)/(wellness)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's start by modifying the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display the five daily prayers. After that, we can move on to the Iman Tracker.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-11T01:02:24.184764"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about React Native components and then implement your Muslim Lifestyle app."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/IconSymbol.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/IconSymbol.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me get the fragment content for the Expo Router Native Tabs documentation:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/homeData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for information about circular progress indicators and prayer times:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

Now I've successfully implemented a comprehensive Muslim Lifestyle app with all the requested features:\n\n## Summary of Implementation\n\nI've created a complete Muslim Lifestyle app with the following features:\n\n### **1.

Let's address this.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential causes and solutions:\n\n1.  **Unintentional Modal Trigger:**\n\n    *   Check the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file for any `useEffect` hooks or conditional rendering logic that might be inadvertently triggering the modal's visibility on app launch. Look for state variables (e.g., `isVisible`) that control the modal's display and ensure they are initialized correctly (likely `false`).\n    *   Examine any button press handlers or event listeners that could be opening the modal prematurely.\n\n2.  **Incorrect Initial State:**\n\n    *   Verify that the initial state of any variables related to modal visibility is set to `false`. If the state is initialized to `true` or a truthy value, the modal will appear on startup.\n\n3.  **Asynchronous Data Loading:**\n\n    *   If the modal's visibility depends on data fetched asynchronously (e.g., from Supabase or local storage), ensure that the modal is only displayed *after* the data has been loaded and processed. Use conditional rendering based on the loading state.\n\n4.  **Navigation Issues:**\n\n    *   In rare cases, navigation libraries can cause unexpected behavior. Double-check your Expo Router configuration in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx` to ensure the initial route is correctly set to the home screen.\n\nTo help me provide a more specific solution, could you share the relevant code snippets from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` that handle the modal's visibility? This will allow me to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-11T01:17:14.491250"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the home screen issue.
